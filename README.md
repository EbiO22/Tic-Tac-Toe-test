# Tic-Tac-Toe-test
I found the task really interesting but also quite challenging. I had read about Angular briefly, but never learned it. Because of this my approach was to find tutorials/blogs about how it works, and most importantly open source code all from Codepen which makes up the vast majority of the code in this repository. 

Reading about gaming algorithms was really fun, but again pretty difficult. The algorithm in this code is Minimax and was part of the original code I found on Codepen. I can't say that I have an in-depth understanding of it, but it does

Design-wise, I decided to go for a pink background because I felt it matched the lighthearted nature of the game and black font as a contrast. 
If I had more time, I would spend it properly integrating AWS Cognito and the API into the game, as well as working on my understanding of Minimax.
